## Background

The Infrared Thermography Temperature Dataset contains temperatures read from various locations of inferred images about patients, with the addition of oral temperatures measured for each individual. The 33 features consist of gender, age, ethnicity, ambiant temperature, humidity, distance, and other temperature readings from the thermal images. The dataset is intended to be used in a regression task to predict the oral temperature using the environment information as well as the thermal image readings.

## Dataset description

Please read the accompanying paper [Infrared Thermography for Measuring Elevated Body Temperature: Clinical Accuracy, Calibration, and Evaluation](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/443b9932d295ca3a014e7d874b4bd77a33a276bd) by Quanzeng Wang, Yangling Zhou, Pejman Ghassemi, David McBride, J. Casamento, T. Pfefer (2021).

## Prediction task

- Train and evaluate a regression model to predict the oral temperature using the environment information as well as the thermal image readings;
- Clarify and evaluate for the first five phases of the CRISP-DM model (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation) by writing a paragraph for each phase, explaining your results and insights.
