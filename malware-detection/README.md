## Background

With the rapid growth of technology and IT-enabled services, the potential damage caused by malware is increasing rapidly. A large number of detection methods have been proposed to arrest the growth of malware attacks. The performance of these detection methods is usually established using raw or feature datasets. This dataset was created to support validation of the effectiveness of a malware detection method.

## TUNADROMD dataset description
The dataset contains 4465 instances and 241 attributes for benign and malware applications for the Android operating system. The target attribute for classification is a category (malware vs good ware). Details of how the dataset is created can be read in the accompanying paper. Note that this dataset is the preprocessed version of TUANDROMD.

## Prediction challenge

- Train and evaluate a binary classifier that predicts whether a given application is malware or good ware
- Clarify and evaluate for the first five phases of the CRISP-DM model (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation) by writing a paragraph for each phase, explaining your results and insights
